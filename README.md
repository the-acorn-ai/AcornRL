# TODOS:
- add eval script (for now just vs 4o-mini)
- add wandb tracker
- add "watch" tracker
- add non-lora training back in


- make it easy to load data from previous N data collection rounds


- reduce the episode_to_details_csv to just one row per episode maybe?

- add force-answer function if cot is too long (and there is a max-seq argument)
