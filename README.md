# TODOS:
- add wandb tracker
- add "watch" tracker
- add non-lora training back in
- make it easy to load data from previous N data collection rounds
- reduce the episode_to_details_csv to just one row per episode maybe?
- add invalid move rate to evals
- add a keep checkpoints flag 
- use prev 2 checkpoints (or more advanced techniques) for model selection
